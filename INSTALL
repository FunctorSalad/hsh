PREREQUISITES
-------------

A more up-to-date version of this information may be found at

  https://software.complete.org/hsh/wiki/RelatedSoftware

You must satisfy one or more of these major categories:

1. GHC 6.6 or above

   HSH requires GHC 6.6 or above. Due to GHC design limitations, HSH
   is not compatible with ghci or the GHC threaded runtime.

   Hugs does not provide an interface to fork(), which is necessary for
   HSH to work. HSH is therefore not compatible with Hugs.


   (for GHC 6.4.0 or 6.4.1, use MissingH 0.14.3 or below)

2. Prerequisite libraries

INSTALLATION
------------

The first step is to generate your setup file.  To do that, run:

  make setup

Now:

 ./setup configure
 ./setup build
 ./setup install

Optionally, to run the unit tests, you'll need to install HUnit.  Then:

 make test

or:

 make test-hugs
